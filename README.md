Step 2:

Install node from https://nodejs.org/.
Make sure you install a version over 8!

Step 3:

run `npm i` while in this directory.

Step 4:

Create a file called config.js based off of the ExampleConfig.js with your user ID and bot token in the apropriate places.

If you are using a linux server (and why wouldn't you)
run `sudo apt get forever` to install forever.
